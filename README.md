## 🧠 How It Works
- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- You choose a difficulty level:
  - **Easy** → 10 attempts  
  - **Hard** → 5 attempts
- After each guess, you’ll get feedback:
  - “Too high” ⬆️
  - “Too low” ⬇️
- Keep guessing until you find the number or run out of attempts!
